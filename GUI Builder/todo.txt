TODO:

1.  Add support for static and dynamic coordinate systems to graphene and 
    redesign frames to use them. That should allow a single movable frame.

2.  Define an interface for controls to report whether they can have a specific 
    (dynamic) type of object to be dropped onto them and what action this will 
	result into. Perhaps along the lines of MultiPart with the returned object
	encapsulating the action and nullptr reporting unsupported types.

3.  Rethink concrete MultiPart frame: perhaps 9 distinct part types is the way 
    to go (instead of a template template parameter).

4.  Factor out common parts from {Pressable, Highlightable, Selectable, 
    Focusable} and {Textual, Named} using function-like macros, but wait till 
    code is further	stabilized before doing so as macros make bug-hunting 
    harder.

5.  Consider adding the 'rebase' protocol to frames for use with the 
    corresponding DSEL. (eases changing BaseType from Omit when non-type and 
    template template parameters are present)
