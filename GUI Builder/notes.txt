Notes:

1.  Had a problem the mouse coordinates and window size reported by freeglut, 
    but it was fixed when I updated to version 2.8.1 (from 2.8.0).

Issues:

1.  Need to redesign the frame architecture. Perhaps pass down FrameStackType to 
    all the frames? Or allow certain frames to store function object callbacks
    internally and call them on certain occasions. The later is one way to allow 
    Pressable frames to thicken the rectangle border used for part calculation.
