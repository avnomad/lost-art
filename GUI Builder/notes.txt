Notes:

1.  Had a problem with the mouse coordinates and window size reported by freeglut,
    but it was fixed when I updated to version 2.8.1 (from 2.8.0).

Issues:

1.  Need to redesign the frame architecture. Perhaps pass down FrameStackType to
    all the frames? Or allow certain frames to store function object callbacks
    internally and call them on certain occasions. The latter is one way to allow
    Pressable frames to thicken the rectangle border used for part calculation.

2.  GLUT functions return character width as an int effectively discarding at
    least 2 digits after decimal point. I can probably fix that by getting the
	length of a string of 100 instances of the same character and dividing.

3.  Currently highlights and other user feedback related to constraints is based
    on calculations done in the previous frame.
